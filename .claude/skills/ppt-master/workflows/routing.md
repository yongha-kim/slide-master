# Routing Rules

Route selection authority for PPT Master. Load this dispatcher before any full
skill or standalone workflow.

**Hard rule — first load**: Do not read the full main `SKILL.md`, the full
`ppt-template-fill` skill, or a standalone workflow to decide the route. Select
the route here, then read only the selected execution owner(s) in full.

**Hard rule — gate ownership**: If this file conflicts with a route summary in
`SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or a user-facing doc, this file wins for
route selection. After selection, the target skill/workflow owns its blocking
points, commands, validation, recovery, and completion criteria. Root summaries
cannot add gates.

### Route-Family Load Contract

| Selected family | Full files to load after selection | Gate owner |
|---|---|---|
| Main SVG generation or PPTX re-architecture | Main [`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) | Main `SKILL.md` Steps 1–7 |
| Strict 1:1 SVG beautify | [`beautify-pptx.md`](./beautify-pptx.md), then main [`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) only at its explicit shared-SVG handoff | Beautify before handoff; main skill for invoked shared steps |
| Raw PPTX template plus new material/topic | [`ppt-template-fill/SKILL.md`](../../ppt-template-fill/SKILL.md) only | Standalone template-fill skill |
| Finished-PPTX native enhancement | [`native-enhance-pptx/SKILL.md`](../../native-enhance-pptx/SKILL.md), then its required [execution workflow](./native-enhance-pptx.md) | Native-enhancement workflow; no main SVG gates |
| Preprocessing, optional, or post-route workflow | Selected workflow; load the next owner only at an explicit handoff | Current workflow until handoff |

**Hard rule — family split**: Main generation and beautify author SVG. Template
fill and native enhancement patch PowerPoint directly. Producing a `.pptx` does
not make a direct route inherit the main SVG skill.

## 1. Routing Discipline

| Rule | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Deterministic routes | Do not ask the user to choose when a request matches a defined route. Enter the route directly. |
| Missing prerequisite | State the missing prerequisite and stop that route. Do not route around the prerequisite with an invented alternative. |
| Ambiguous deck optimization | Ask exactly one discriminator question: preserve original page count/order and slide wording, or treat the deck as source material and restructure it? Keep only this router loaded until the answer selects an owner. |
| Explicit user override | Honor explicit route instructions only when the route preconditions are satisfied. |
| Summary conflict | Use this file for route choice, then read only the selected route owner(s) before executing it. |

**Forbidden - route-choice prompts**: Do not present multiple implementation paths when this file already defines the route. Ordinary style choices and finite options belong at the next existing confirmation gate.

### 1.1 SVG Page-Design Scope

| Route family | SVG contract |
|---|---|
| Main SVG pipeline and `beautify-pptx` | Every visible output-page object is authored in the completed page SVG; templates and locks guide authoring but are not export-time visual overlays. |
| `create-template` | Each reusable template SVG is a complete visual reference plus explicit PowerPoint structure metadata. Library and project outputs use the same routing: required `templates/`, optional `images/` / `icons/`, and optional on-demand review output under `exports/`. |
| `ppt-template-fill` (standalone skill) and `native-enhance-pptx` | Native PPTX editing routes. They retain their OOXML contracts and are not forced through SVG. |
| Animation, transition, speaker-note, and narration workflows | Presentation behavior/content outside the visible page-design layer; keep their dedicated sidecars and package post-processing. |

**Hard rule**: Apply SVG page-design closure only after selecting an SVG-authoring route. Do not reroute a native PPTX operation merely to make every package-level capability pass through SVG.

## 2. Main Route Matrix

| Request shape | Trigger | Route | Forbidden route | Preconditions | Output contract | Stop condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Topic only, no source facts | User supplies only a topic name or requirement and no substantive source material | [`topic-research`](./topic-research.md), then main `SKILL.md` pipeline | Direct main pipeline with invented facts | Web/source gathering is allowed or user supplies facts | Research material becomes source input for Step 1 | Stop if facts cannot be gathered and the user supplies no source |
| Source material can be reworked into a new story | PDF/DOCX/URL/Markdown/text/conversation content, or PPTX treated as content | Main `SKILL.md` pipeline | Direct PPTX edit workflows | Source content exists or is available in conversation | `design_spec.md`, `spec_lock.md`, `svg_output/`, exported PPTX | Stop at Step gates when required artifacts are missing |
| PPTX as re-architectable source | User allows page count/order/outline to change, or asks to split/merge/drop/reorder slides | Main `SKILL.md` pipeline with `ppt_to_md.py` plus PPTX intake | [`beautify-pptx`](./beautify-pptx.md) | PPTX source exists | Markdown content plus `analysis/source_profile.json`; Strategist may re-outline | Stop if user requires exact 1:1 page preservation |
| Explicit template workspace path | User provides a current brand/layout/deck workspace root containing `templates/design_spec.md`, or a compatible legacy-flat root containing `design_spec.md` | Main `SKILL.md` Step 3 | Fuzzy template lookup by bare name; passing a current workspace's inner `templates/` directory instead of its root | Path resolves, frontmatter kind is valid, and every deck/layout SVG satisfies the current structured Master/Layout/slot contract | Stage `templates/` plus any existing `images/` and `icons/` into the target project peers; consume the target project's own root in place; never consume the review-only `exports/` directory | Route only a structurally legacy SVG contract to [`restore-pptx-structure`](./restore-pptx-structure.md) before Step 3; a legacy-flat directory shape alone remains compatible and does not trigger restoration |

---

## 3. PPTX-Specific Routes

| Request shape | Trigger | Route | Forbidden route | Preconditions | Output contract | Stop condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Raw PPTX template plus new material/topic | "Use this PPT template to generate a PPTX", "fill this deck", "replace copy", native slide shell reuse | [`ppt-template-fill` skill](../../ppt-template-fill/SKILL.md) | Main SVG pipeline directly from raw PPTX template | Source PPTX plus content material or topic brief | New native PPTX in `exports/`, cloned/patched by OOXML, gated by the skill's OfficeCLI verification loop | Stop if user instead wants a reusable template package |
| Existing PPTX, preserve page split and wording | "Beautify", "re-layout", "make more professional" with same slide count/order and verbatim text | [`beautify-pptx`](./beautify-pptx.md) | Main pipeline if page count/order changes | Single source PPTX | Regenerated deck through SVG pipeline, one source slide to one output slide | Stop if user asks to split/merge/drop/reorder |
| Finished PPTX, native enhancement only | Add or replace speaker notes, recorded narration/audio, auto-advance timing, or slide transitions | [`native-enhance-pptx` skill](../../native-enhance-pptx/SKILL.md), which loads the execution workflow | SVG regeneration | Finished PPTX exists; content/layout should stay stable | Patched PPTX through direct OOXML | Stop if user asks for visual redesign |
| PPTX/reference design should become a reusable template | "Create a template", "make reusable", "build template from this deck/design", including a template for one named initialized project | [`create-template`](./create-template.md) | `ppt-template-fill` one-off fill | PPTX/design reference exists, or the user gives an explicit template-creation brief; project output additionally requires an initialized target project | Both scopes produce one workspace with required `templates/`, optional `images/` / `icons/`, and optional on-demand `exports/<id>_template_preview.pptx`; library root is `.claude/skills/ppt-master/templates/<kind>/<id>/`, project root is `projects/<name>/`; only library scope is registered | Return the exact workspace root for main Step 3; the target project's own root may resume in place after validation |

**Hard rule**: Raw PPTX template plus "generate PPTX" routes to the `ppt-template-fill` skill by default. A raw PPTX is not a Step 3 template until `create-template` has produced a reusable template directory.

**Hard rule**: Beautify is strictly 1:1. Any page count or page order change is re-architecture and therefore the main pipeline, not beautify.

## 4. Optional and Post-Route Workflows

| Request shape | Trigger | Route | Preconditions | Output contract | Stop condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Brand identity setup | Brand asset, brand site URL, branded PPTX/PDF, or explicit brand setup request | [`create-brand`](./create-brand.md) | Brand source exists or can be inspected | Complete identity-only workspace under `templates/brands/<id>/` | Stop if no brand source or brand intent exists |
| Continue a split-mode project | "Continue generating `projects/<name>`" after the planning session | [`resume-execute`](./resume-execute.md) | Project has planning-session artifacts | Execution-session SVG generation and export | Stop if required planning artifacts are missing |
| Refine spec before generation | User explicitly asks to refine/review/revise the spec before SVG work, or confirms `refine_spec: true` | [`refine-spec`](./refine-spec.md) | Strategist confirmation stage completed | Revised `design_spec.md` and `spec_lock.md` before Step 5/6 | Stop until user approves the refined spec |
| Restore legacy PowerPoint structure | Existing structured/template SVGs use unmapped `baseline`, `preserve`, `layout_strategy: distill`, `data-pptx-layout-kind`, `distilled`/`utility`, direct atomic placeholders, or an incomplete root Master identity | [`restore-pptx-structure`](./restore-pptx-structure.md) before generation/export or before Step 3 template consumption | Legacy structured SVG project/package exists; original PPTX/native facts are used when available; an explicit `mode: flat` free-design/brand-only project and a flat package directory are not triggers | Current structured SVG contract plus complete `pptx_masters`/`pptx_layouts` mapping | Stop if structure cannot be restored without an explicit design decision |
| Data chart calibration | Generated deck contains data charts | [`verify-charts`](./verify-charts.md) between Step 6 and Step 7 | SVG pages exist | Calibrated chart coordinates before export | Stop on chart geometry errors until fixed |
| Object-level animation tuning | User asks for animation order, timing, effects, or object reveal behavior | [`customize-animations`](./customize-animations.md) | SVG groups / exported context exist | `animations.json` or validated animation config | Stop if requested target objects cannot be identified |
| Live preview / element selection / annotations | User mentions live preview, preview, visual check in browser, clicking/selecting an element, or applying browser annotations | [`live-preview`](./live-preview.md) | Project exists; for annotation apply, generated SVGs exist | Running preview service or applied annotations plus re-export | Stop only if project path or SVGs are missing |
| Visual review | User explicitly asks for per-page visual self-check or visual rubric | [`visual-review`](./visual-review.md) between Step 6 and Step 7 | SVG pages exist | Visual review findings and fixes before post-processing | Do not run without explicit user request |
| Recorded narration / video export | User asks for narration, voiceover, or video-style export | [`generate-audio`](./generate-audio.md) after post-processing | Notes and exported deck exist | Audio files and optional narration-embedded PPTX | Stop for the workflow's single backend/voice confirmation |
| Post-export PPTX verification | User explicitly asks to verify / QA / check an exported `.pptx` | [`verify-pptx-export`](./verify-pptx-export.md) after Step 7.3 or after a direct-PPTX workflow export | Exported PPTX exists; OfficeCLI installed | Triaged package/issue/render findings with fixes routed upstream | A default one-pass contact-sheet sanity scan may recommend this route, but recommendation is not entry; run only after explicit user approval and stop if OfficeCLI is missing |

---

## 5. Template Name Boundary

| User input | Route behavior |
|---|---|
| Explicit current brand/layout/deck workspace root containing `templates/design_spec.md` | Enter main Step 3 template option; use the workspace root, not its inner `templates/` directory |
| Explicit legacy-flat root containing `design_spec.md` | Enter main Step 3 through the compatibility reader; flat packaging alone does not require structure restoration |
| No explicit path — "use a template" intent, a bare brand/deck name, a style label, or silence | Ask the single recommendation question (SKILL.md Step 3): up to 3 matching brand/deck paths + free design; a brand/deck answer enters Step 3 as a confirmed explicit path. Names and style labels only rank the candidates |
| Explicit no-template instruction, or a SKILL.md Step 3 skip condition | Skip the question; free design (the Stage 1 template card still offers the deck library) |
| Bare layout name | Do not install; layouts enter only through an explicit path. Treat the name as style input for the Strategist confirmation stage |
| User asks "what templates exist?" | Answer as Q&A by listing indexed paths; do not advance the pipeline |
| Raw `.pptx` called a template | Route by §3, usually the `ppt-template-fill` skill; never treat it as a Step 3 template path |

**Forbidden - fuzzy resolution**: Do not resolve bare names to local template directories and install them on the user's behalf. Names only rank the single recommendation question; the path that enters Step 3 is always one the user confirmed (their answer, an explicit path, or the Stage 1 template card). For every current template kind, that path is the workspace root.
